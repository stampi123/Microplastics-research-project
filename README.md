# Microplastics Concentrations and Policy Effectivness Research Study
This was my senior year research paper for an experiential learning data science course at UCSD (COGS 108). 

## Overview: 

### Research Question
**How do global policies passed each year impact subsequent rates of oceanic microplastic concentration?**

### Background
**In this research project, we analyzed the effectiveness of plastic policies on the actual rates of microplastic increase in the ocean. The accumulation of these invisible plastics is a growing concern and may have long term effects.**

### Data Processing
